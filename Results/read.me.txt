Due to size limited in Github, I split the database into two files.
you can combine these two by this code, also you can search them individually :D

'''
# Combine all CSV files into two files in python
import csv
import pandas as pd
combined_csv = pd.concat([pd.read_csv(f'SRDP_results_all_cds_combined_{i}.csv') for i in ['A','B']])
combined_csv.to_csv("SRDP_results_all_cds_combined_all.csv", index=False)

In file named DrugBank, you can check gene-drug

With these three files, you can easily get: [V/R gene] to [R/V gene] to [Drug] and assist your experiment
