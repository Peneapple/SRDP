Here are all my codes and some small size data.
For large files, links are listed here: 

1) cds gene DNA and protein sequecne: https://useast.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Info/Index \
2) protein structure: https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000005640 \
3ï¼‰ACS cancer date: https://cancerstatisticscenter.cancer.org/#!/data-analysis/SurvivalByStage \
4) our prediction result in folder named Results, a 'read.me' in it which can help you to use our results easily \

If you meet any problem when u are running the codes or using the data, please contact me. :D
