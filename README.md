SRDP: Predicting Synthetic Rescue Effect in Cancer Drug Resistance Through Multimodal Deep Learning

We are considering using more genome information, especially the rest of the all gene to study more complex SR effect, cause we received some advices that using just two genes is a little simple, and it is just like a binary classification. 
We are trying to integrate more biological mechanism into the project, welcome to contact us and communicate!

Here are all my codes and some small size data.
For large files, links are listed here: 

1) cds gene DNA and protein sequecne: https://useast.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Info/Index 
2) protein structure: https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000005640
3) ACS cancer date: https://cancerstatisticscenter.cancer.org/#!/data-analysis/SurvivalByStage

our prediction result in folder named Results, a 'read.me' in it which can help you to use our results easily 

If you meet any problem when u are running the codes or using the data, please contact me. :D
